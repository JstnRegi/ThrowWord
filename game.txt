How do I implement a db?
	Clarifications on identity of game?
		A user can play a Quick Match where they use their builtin playlist and they can add words until minimum amount of words are met
		A user can click if they want words to be automatically deleted if the word is guessed correctly, or not be deleted

What a game should be.

A gamemode can be chosen
	Quick Matches
	Rule Rounds


A quick match ends when the time ends for both sides
	- In order to play another quick round, the list of words must at least be as long as many players x 3
	- The following Quick Match played uses the words from last round that was not used
	- Game maker can decide on best of many rounds the teams will play
	- Save a Quick Match playlist for the user?
		- As long as minimum requirement is met
	- Give game maker a chance on to use old words or use a previous one
